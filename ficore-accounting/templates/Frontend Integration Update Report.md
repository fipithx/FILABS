Frontend Integration Update Report
Overview
This report documents the updates made to the business/home.html and personal/home.html templates to ensure consistent frontend integration with their respective backend blueprints (business_finance.py and summaries.py). The updates align the JavaScript endpoints, notification displays, and styling to maintain compatibility with existing CSS and backend functionality.

2. Notifications Section

Added a notifications section to both templates with consistent markup (notification-card, notification-item, notification-icon, notification-content, notification-description, notification-time).
Included a notification count badge (#notificationCount) with dynamic styling (bg-danger for unread, bg-primary for zero).
Added "View All" links pointing to the respective blueprintâ€™s notifications endpoint.
Applied identical CSS styles in both templates to ensure visual consistency.

3. JavaScript Updates

Implemented loadNotifications in both templates to fetch and display notifications and update the count badge, with error handling and fallback UI.
Added getNotificationIcon to map notification types to Bootstrap icons, aligned with backend functions (email, sms, whatsapp for business; info, warning, error, success for personal).
Ensured loadRecentActivity and getActivityIcon/getActivityColor functions align with backend activity types.
Retained identical formatTimeAgo, toggleAmountVisibility, and format_currency functions for consistent behavior.

4. Styling and Structure

Preserved all existing CSS class names (e.g., page-container, section-card, summary-cards) to maintain compatibility with the existing CSS file.
Added notification-specific styles in the <style> block, identical across both templates, to ensure consistent appearance.

5. Backend Consistency

Aligned frontend endpoints with the business_finance.py (/business prefix) and summaries.py (/summaries prefix) blueprints.
Ensured getNotificationIcon and activity-related functions match backend icon mappings.

6. Artifact IDs

business/home.html: Used existing UUID (fd99f8a0-981c-442c-94a6-a3e1ce959d5f) for updates.
personal/home.html: Assigned new UUID (7b8e9f2a-3c4d-4e5f-9876-1234567890ab) as a distinct template.
Report: Assigned new UUID (9c8e2f3b-4a5e-4f6a-9874-5678901234cd).

Conclusion
The updates ensure both templates integrate seamlessly with their respective backend blueprints, maintain consistent UI/UX for notifications and activities, and preserve CSS compatibility. Future enhancements may include interactive notification features or updates to related templates (e.g., base.html).
